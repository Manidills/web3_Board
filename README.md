## Problems

* Lack of INTERACTIVE web3 protocols dashboards avilable publicaly. Dune started a major step on that but still users need sql stuffs to get the req data.
* Finding the trending and rare NFT Tokens are difficult.
* No simple userface to extract and download NFT related or wallet related historical and detailed data.
* Lack of publically avilable place scan and get detailed bug reports for smart contracts. (INDEED)
* Personalized IPFS upload's and URL link managements.
